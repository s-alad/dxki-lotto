# dxki-lotto
## Decentralized Lottery Built on Solidity, Nextjs, Polygon & ThirdWeb

#### You can deploy it yourself on thirdweb and switch the contract addresses in the code. 
Currently the contract deployer & admin must pick the winner to reset the lottery.

Note: This is not the most secure dApp, you can in theory buy all the tickets as that is only handled on client side because I was too lazy.   
Note: There is a lot of spagetti code.
